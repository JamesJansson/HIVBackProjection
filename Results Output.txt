The healthy CD4 count distribution had a median of 890 and standard deviation of 0.338
The healthy CD4 count distribution had an interquartile range of (710-1120)

The time it takes for the median CD4 count to reach 500 is 2(1.35-2.7) years.
The time it takes for the median CD4 count to reach 350 is 4.4(3.6-5.3) years.
The time it takes for the median CD4 count to reach 200 is 7(6.2-8.05) years.

The median estimated time between infection and diagnosis was 4.5 (IQR: 2.9-6.6) years for diagnoses with CD4 counts of 200cells/microL at diagnosis.
The median estimated time between infection and diagnosis was 2.8 (IQR: 1.4-4.7) years for diagnoses with CD4 counts of 350cells/microL at diagnosis.
The median estimated time between infection and diagnosis was 2.0 (IQR: 0.9-3.6) years for diagnoses with CD4 counts of 500cells/microL at diagnosis.

the number of infections that are placed in 2013 is 350 (331-377)
The peak estimated infections (1384 [1251-1647]) that occurred in 1984 is somewhat lower than the peak diagnoses (2148) in 1987 as there was a back-log of infections that occurred earlier which needed to be cleared.
Following this peak, infections reached a low of 627 (586-677) in 1997.
There were 912 (835-1002) infections in the final year of data, with 938 diagnoses in the final year of data, ...

Figure 5a
The model estimates that the annual testing probabilty fell to the lowest point (p=0.26 [0.23-0.30]) in 1999, the year which coincides with the lowest number of diagnoses. Testing probailities are calculated to have increased since then, with the annual testing probability in the final year of data at p=0.34 (0.28-0.39). 
Figure 5b
 The median time between infection and diagnosis for people diagnosed in the last year of data was estimated at 0.9 (IQR: 0.1-3.7) years.
Mean time between infection and diagnosis in the final year of data was 2.423 years
 This is a substantial reduction from 1985, where median time until diagnosis was estimated to be 4.1 (IQR: 2.1-5.7) years.
Mean time between infection and diagnosis in 1985 was 3.9927 years

Note that this section calculates the uncertainty in the mean and median estimate, and does not represent the distribution of individuals within a particular simulation
The mean time between infection and diagnosis in the final year of simulation is etimated to be 2.423(1.9968-2.9514) years.
The median time between infection and diagnosis in the final year of simulation is etimated to be 0.95391(0.7653-1.158) years.
Elapsed time is 31280.437426 seconds.
